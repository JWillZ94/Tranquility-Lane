    "description": "This is where it all started...the beginning of my track and field journey. This is the track at my old high school, it has a very nostalgic effect on me, however, it's the worst track I've ever ran on. The material is basically concrete, provides no bounce, but the turns are good, if your spikes can actually grip the track. Beware...if you fall down on this track, it will definitely take a chunk of your skin with it."

    "description": "Also a fairly nostalgic track for me, this is another place where I've trained many times and ran the most difficult workouts at. I love this track, its very soft and bouncy so it feels good to run on and the wide turns make them easy to sprint on. This track has recently been resurfaced and I'd to run on it again sometime."
