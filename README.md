# Tranquility-Lane
This is a website I made to showcase the track and field facilities that I've been to over the years of my journey as a track and field athlete. I made this website with React.js as the front-end framework, this website is also responsive to any screen size and contains a clever animation that imitates a sprint start in track and field. The purpose of this website was to show my passion for track and field and to improve my front-end design and React.js skills.
